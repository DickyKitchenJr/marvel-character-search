# marvel-character-search

a site for users to input a character name and return a image and bio for that Marvel character using the Marvel API

## Purpose:

- to create a site using Next.js and the Marvel API
- show ability return requested information based on user input

## Resources Used:

- Nextjs
- official Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/)
- Vercel to simplify deployment

### Challenges along the way:

- used default information to account for Marvel API not being up to date with character bios, images, etc.
- reached out to the Marvel customer service provided through the API site in an attempt to find out if there were plans to continue with the API or if I could update sections for them (because I am a fan of Marvel and have been a comic book geek for a long time). Unfortunately I was never able to get a reply from the listed customer service resource.
- if this project was to move forward beyond being used strictly for a portfolio piece, I would either have to go with a different API or try to build one myself as the amount of information missing from the official Marvel API is too substantial
